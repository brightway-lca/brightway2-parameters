# This file defines units, which can be found in the ecoinvent database
# and are not understood by pint out of the box. Defining them manually
# ensures that they can be parsed by bw2parameters. The definition syntax
# is described in the pint user manual
# (https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/defining.html).
# Short version: unit name = [unit dimensionality] or conversion formula
# = (optional symbol) = aliases. A '_' in the third position is necessary
# if no symbol is desired, but aliases should be defined.

# pint defines "ton" as "short ton" (2000 pounds) by default
ton = 1000 kg

# ecoinvent specific units
unit = [unit]
person = [person] = _ = guest
night = [time]
EUR2005 = [currency]
